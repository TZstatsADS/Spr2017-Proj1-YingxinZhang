# Project 1: An R notebook story about US presidents' inaugural speeches

### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2017

+ Projec title: An R notebook story about US presidents' inaugural speeches
+ This project is conducted by [Yingxin Zhang]

+ Project summary: The inauguration speech of an American president is always a reflection of the president's advocacy and his intended policies during his tenure. By using natural language process techniques, we can transform these perceptual expressions into quantified results and try to capture some common characteristics as well as unique aspects of these speeches.
